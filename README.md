Data Analysis Internship Tasks 

Future Intern

Overview:

This repository contains the code and documentation for the tasks completed during my data analyst internship at Future Intern. The tasks involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. Below are the details for each task:

Task 1: Handling Missing Values and Outliers
Objective:
To clean the dataset by handling missing values and identifying and addressing outliers.

Steps:

Missing Values Handling:
Identified missing values in the dataset.
Used methods like mean/median imputation and forward/backward fill to handle missing data.
Outliers Detection and Treatment:
Used the IQR (Interquartile Range) method to detect outliers.
Treated outliers by capping, flooring, or removal based on the context of the data.

Task 2: Summary Statistics Calculation

Objective:
To calculate and interpret summary statistics for the given dataset.

Steps:

Calculated key summary statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, minimum, and maximum.
Interpreted the results to understand the distribution and central tendencies of the data.

Task 3: Data Visualization Using Histograms

Objective:

To visualize the distribution of data using histograms.

Steps:

Created histograms for various features in the dataset.
Analyzed the shape of the distributions, including skewness, kurtosis, and normality.
